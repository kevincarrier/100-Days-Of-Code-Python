Instructions
You are going to write a program which will mark a spot with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list.
When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

In the starting code, we have used new lines (\n) to format the three rows into a square, like this:

This is to try and simulate the coordinates on a real map.

Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number. e.g.:

Hint
Remember that Lists start at index 0!
map is just a variable that contains a nested list. It's not related to the map function in Python.
